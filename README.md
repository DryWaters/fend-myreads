# MyReads Project
MyReads project is a React application that pulls from a backend supplied by Udacity that will allow users to categorize their books based on the critera of "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read".  This project is part of the [Udacity Front-End Developer Nanoprogram](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## Instructions
Books are placed in the different categories by clicking the down arrow on the bottom right corner of a book.  To remove a book totally from your book shelves click "none".  To add books to your collection, click on the + icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.  This will take you to a new screen where you can search for additional books to add to your collection.

Search terms are limited as this is just a demo application for the Front-End Nanodegree program.  Please read the [Search Terms](https://github.com/DryWaters/fend-myreads/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md) for the valid search terms.
